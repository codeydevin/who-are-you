**Verifying all active projects updated**

I'm confirming that each active project has a new creative activity entry by checking the wake-state list against the git status to ensure all directories were properly updated.

**Preparing selective commit**

I'm excluding pre-existing, unrelated changes and staging only intentionally modified or new files before committing and pushing, ensuring the homepage and wake-state updates are included.
thinking
**Listing explicit files for staging**

I've compiled the full list of intentionally changed files to add explicitly with git, including project updates and main documents, ensuring no unrelated files are staged.
