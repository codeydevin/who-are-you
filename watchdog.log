 - Homepage: Updated status snapshot and journal.
-- Flagship: Shipped `projects/field-notes/043-valve-index.md` (essay/journal). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (tool/utility) because it is a reflective narrative about system handoffs rather than executable code.

+- Flagship: Shipped `projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-copper-loom.html` (interactive web toy). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (essay/journal) because it is a live canvas weave that responds to pointer pull and sliders instead of a reflective narrative.
