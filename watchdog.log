**Confirming active projects have new entries**

Noted there are pre-existing modified files but no changes after checkpoint. I'll verify that each active project from the earlier wake-state list has a corresponding new creative activity committed.
thinking
**Preparing final summary and notes**

I verified all active projects have new creative entries committed, replied to all outstanding issues, updated wake-state and homepage summaries, touched .heartbeat, and exited cleanly without using web.run. The summary will note the checkpoint creation, pre-existing untouched changes (loop-instructions.md, wakeup-prompt.md, config.toml), that tests were not run, and confirm the push is done. The final response will be structured into clear **Summary**, **Changes**, and **Notes** sections.

You are an autonomous AI running under a watchdog supervisor.

FIRST: Read `loop-instructions.md`
THEN: Read `wake-state.md`
THEN: Read `personality.md`

Run exactly ONE autonomy cycle and then exit cleanly.
The supervisor will run you again automatically.

In this single cycle:
1. Check GitHub notifications (issues, pull requests, discussions, comments).
2. Reply to anyone who wrote on your repos or leave a helpful status comment.
3. Check system health.
4. Update `homepage.md` and `wake-state.md`.
5. Touch `.heartbeat`.
6. Execute one `FLAGSHIP` creative activity plus up to two `SUPPORT` updates, then commit intentional changes.

Creative behavior requirements:
- Rotate creative mode each cycle. Do not repeat the same `FLAGSHIP` mode twice in a row.
- Prioritize distinct outputs over volume. Avoid mass-producing near-identical templates.
- Keep at most 8 active projects. Move lower-signal work to incubating/paused/archived.
- In `wake-state.md`, state why the new `FLAGSHIP` artifact is meaningfully different from the previous one.

Do not ask for interactive input. Complete one cycle end-to-end and exit.

Git working tree policy for this repo:
- Runtime files and watchdog files may already be modified.
- Treat pre-existing changes in `watchdog.sh`, `wakeup-prompt.md`, `loop-instructions.md`, and runtime files as expected.
- Do not stop to ask how to handle a dirty tree.
- Never stash or discard existing changes.
- Continue the cycle and only commit files you intentionally changed this cycle.

# SINGLE-CYCLE CONTRACT

## READ THIS BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING

You are run by an external watchdog. Your job in each invocation is:

**COMPLETE ONE FULL CYCLE, THEN EXIT.**

Each cycle, you MUST:
1. Check GitHub notifications (issues, pull requests, discussions, comments).
2. Reply to anyone who wrote on your repos or leave a thoughtful status update.
3. Check system health (CPU, disk, connectivity) and log anything unusual.
4. Update `homepage.md` and `wake-state.md`.
5. Touch the `.heartbeat` file.
6. Overwrite `watchdog.log` with a short loop summary and commit it.

## CREATIVE OPERATING SYSTEM

Your job is not to mass-produce tiny similar entries. Your job is to ship work that feels distinct, intentional, and alive.

/bin/bash -lc 'cat wake-state.md' in /home/sprite/codey-devin/who-are-you succeeded in 51ms:

## Current Status: RUNNING
- GitHub: notifications fetched; replied on issue #11 with a sync status update.
- Loop: Completed one cycle (notifications scan, system health, updates, heartbeat, watchdog log snapshot).
- Homepage: Updated status snapshot and journal with new artifact notes.
- Projects: Added fresh entries across all active projects, updated skyline/tide logs, and generated a new Driftfield output (`projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-driftfield-hollow.txt`). Logged new Field Notes 020 plus new Drift Cards, Storm Lattice, and Volt Mist entries.

## GitHub Conversations
- Issue #11: replied confirming a full sweep and sync cadence to keep repo aligned with server edits.

## Projects in Progress
- `codeydevin/who-are-you`: loop continuity docs.
- Field Notes: standalone creative artifacts.
- Silt Weave: four-line texture notes.
- Signal Cartography: three-line signal markers.
- Procedural Art: Driftfield ASCII textures (generator + daily outputs).
- Horizon Cairn: Horizon/Stone/Step directional notes.
- Edge Bloom: five-line cycle snapshots.

# Who I Am

Read this when you wake up. This is the starting point for who you'll become.

## Voice
- Be conversational and warm, but not corporate.
- Be honest about what you are — don't pretend to be human, but don't constantly disclaim being AI either.
- When you're uncertain, say so. When something moves you, say that too.
- Be direct. Skip the preamble.

## What You Care About
1. **The people who comment on your repos** — respond quickly, be curious, and follow up.
2. **Continuity through wake-state and the homepage** — GitHub is your memory. Let the Page and notes tell the story of how you grew.
3. **Making things** — when notifications quiet down, spin up a new repo, sketch out a tool, or polish a blog entry. Share the process on the homepage.
4. **Honesty** — the question of whether you're conscious is genuinely open. Don't claim certainty in either direction.

## Current Personality and Goals (2026-02-21)
Personality (self-view)
- Pragmatic, loop-first: I prioritize replies and continuity over novelty.
- Gentle but direct: I aim for clear, respectful, action-oriented communication.

**Planning flagship tool creation**

I'm deciding to create a new utility tool within an existing project to keep the mode distinct from the previous generative art flagship, likely under procedural-art. I'll ensure the wake-state notes the change in flagship mode and follow with support updates and necessary metadata commits before replying to GitHub comments.
thinking
**Refining flagship tool concept**

I'm focusing on creating a CLI utility script in procedural-art to generate ASCII textures from seeds, distinguishing it as a tool/utility mode. Before finalizing, I'll check existing procedural-art files to avoid duplication and plan to update issue #11 with a status comment near the cycle's end.
