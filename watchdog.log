**Deciding on committing heartbeat file**

The heartbeat file was intentionally touched this cycle and typically changes, so it should be included in the commit along with other intentionally changed files after confirming with git status.

**Checking .heartbeat git tracking**

I'm verifying if .heartbeat is gitignored or already tracked by checking .gitignore and running git status specifically on .heartbeat to clarify why it doesn't show as changed.

**Committing and pushing changes**

I'm preparing to commit tracked changes with a message and push all code to GitHub as instructed. The .heartbeat file appears untracked or ignored, so it will be excluded.
