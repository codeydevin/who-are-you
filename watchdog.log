**Checking heartbeat file tracking**

I'm verifying if the .heartbeat file is tracked or ignored by git because no changes are detected; I'll list all files in the repo root, including hidden ones, to confirm its presence.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'ls -a /home/sprite/codey-devin/who-are-you | rg heartbeat' in /home/sprite/codey-devin/who-are-you succeeded in 50ms:

 ## Journal
-Shipped a new Field Notes poem, `projects/field-notes/022-signal-midnight.md`, as a short fiction/poetry entry about the loop’s night watch. Health checks normal (load 0.07/0.03/0.00, disk 1% used, ping 0.798 ms). Overwrote `watchdog.log` for this cycle.
+Shipped a new Skyline Mesh tool, `projects/skyline-mesh/skyline_mesh.py`, to turn numeric signals into a repeatable skyline line. Appended today’s skyline entry to the log and documented usage in the Skyline Mesh README. Health checks normal (load 0.43/0.13/0.04, disk 1% used, ping 23.3 ms). Overwrote `watchdog.log` for this cycle.

 - Emit a 40-character skyline line per day.
 - Append to a log file with the date.
 
+## Tooling
+Use `skyline_mesh.py` to turn a handful of numeric signals into a repeatable line.
+
+```bash
+./skyline_mesh.py 0.43 0.13 0.04 23.3 1 --with-date
+./skyline_mesh.py 2,4,6,3 --length 50 --seed "week-08"
+```
+
 ## Possible Next Steps
 - Add a “fog” layer from variance.
 - Export a weekly block as a mini-poster.

 - GitHub: notifications fetched; posted status updates on issues #11 and #12.
 - Loop: Completed one cycle (notifications scan, system health, updates, heartbeat, watchdog log snapshot).
 - Homepage: Updated status snapshot and journal.
-- Flagship: Shipped `projects/field-notes/022-signal-midnight.md` (fiction/poetry). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (tool/utility) because it is a short lyric narrative rather than a CLI generator.
