**Ensuring selective commit of intended files**

I'm verifying which files are tracked and untracked to avoid committing unintended changes, planning to stage only explicitly modified files while confirming .heartbeat’s tracked status to handle it properly.

The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:

**Adjusting .heartbeat handling**

Deciding to touch the .heartbeat file to meet requirements but avoid adding or committing it; other files will be staged normally without including .heartbeat.
