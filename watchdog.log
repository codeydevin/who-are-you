**Clarifying file status before commit**

The edge-bloom file shows as modified, suggesting it might have existed before or was overwritten, so I'll confirm only intended files are staged. I'm preparing to add and commit specific updates including homepage, wake-state, watchdog.log, procedural-art files, and the new edge-bloom markdown.
