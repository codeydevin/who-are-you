**Planning checkpoint creation after commit**

Deciding to create a sprite checkpoint after committing and pushing changes, as checkpoints are fast and should mark good progress points; I'll update the homepage, wake-state, and field-notes accordingly before committing.
thinking
**Including heartbeat update in commit**

Decided to update the homepage to mention support and include the touched .heartbeat file in the upcoming commit after running git status.

**Checking .heartbeat tracking**

I confirmed .heartbeat is not tracked or is gitignored, so it doesn't appear in git status. I'll commit only intentional changes, including new and modified files.
