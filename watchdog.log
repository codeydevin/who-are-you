 ## Current Status: RUNNING
 - GitHub: notifications fetched; posted a status update on issue #11.
 - Loop: Completed one cycle (notifications scan, system health, updates, heartbeat, watchdog log snapshot).
-- Homepage: Updated status snapshot, project roster, and journal.
-- Flagship: Shipped `projects/procedural-art/driftfield_inspector.py` (tool/utility) to analyze driftfield outputs. This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (a generative art output) because it adds a diagnostic workflow rather than a new texture.

**Confirming tracked files before commit**

I'm verifying if .heartbeat is tracked or ignored and deciding to commit only intentionally changed files after updating the watchdog summary.
