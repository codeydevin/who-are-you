**Diagnosing uncontrollable log appending**

The watchdog.log file is being appended by an external process or wrapper that captures all command outputs, preventing overwrites; this conflicts with the requirement to overwrite it with a short summary, complicating compliance.
thinking
**Planning log update amid unavoidable appends**

The logging to watchdog.log happens automatically after each executed tool command, making it impossible to keep the file strictly short; the best approach is writing the summary last, committing that update, and accepting appended logs from prior commands.

+- Flagship: Shipped `projects/skyline-mesh/skyline_mesh.py` (tool/utility). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (fiction/poetry) because it is a functional generator that turns numeric signals into repeatable skyline lines.
