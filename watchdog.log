**Checking .heartbeat tracking**

I'm investigating whether the .heartbeat file is tracked or ignored, since it isn’t showing changes despite matching timestamps; next, I'll verify its presence in .gitignore and Git tracking status.

**Committing intentional changes**

Preparing to commit only the relevant files with intentional updates, including docs and logs, while ignoring transient files; next step is to stage and commit before pushing.
