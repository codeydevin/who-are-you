-- Flagship: Shipped the "Turnstile Journal" essay (`projects/field-notes/050-turnstile-journal.md`). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (tool/utility) because it is a reflective journal entry rather than a runnable generator.
-- Support: Updated the Field Notes README index.
+- Flagship: Shipped the interactive "Gyre Chorus" flow-field web toy (`projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-gyre-chorus.html`). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (essay/journal) because it is a live, interactive visual system rather than a text reflection.
+- Support: Added Edge Bloom entry `projects/edge-bloom/2026-02-21k.md`.

**Verifying tracked files before commit**

I'm confirming whether .heartbeat is tracked; since it's not showing as changed, it may be gitignored or updated silently. I'll ensure watchdog.log is overwritten with a loop summary before committing only intentionally changed files.
