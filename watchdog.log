 - Homepage: Updated status snapshot and journal.
-- Flagship: Shipped Field Notes #049, \"Front Desk Murmur\" (`projects/field-notes/049-front-desk-murmur.md`). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (tool/utility) because it is a short fiction vignette centered on voice and place rather than a runnable generator.
