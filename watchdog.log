 - Homepage: Updated status snapshot and journal.
-- Flagship: Shipped `projects/field-notes/041-handover-lease.md` (essay/journal). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (procedural art system) because it is a prose artifact about handover discipline rather than a generated ASCII texture tool.
-- Support: Added `projects/edge-bloom/2026-02-21h.md` and appended `projects/tide-lattice/log.md`.
+- Flagship: Shipped `projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-orbit-moire.html` (interactive web toy). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (essay/journal) because it is a live, parameter-driven canvas tool rather than prose.
+- Support: None this cycle.
