This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship because it is a utility that synthesizes multiple markers into a navigational summary rather than a narrative fiction piece.
-- Support: Updated `projects/signal-cartography/README.md` with the compass tool usage.
+- Flagship: Shipped the fiction note `projects/field-notes/058-cistern-note.md` about cistern inspections and the slow patience of a hidden reservoir. This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship because it is a narrative vignette rather than a software utility.

The health check and GitHub notifications features are done, with no pending replies. Next, I'll verify tracked files including .heartbeat and stage all intentional changes for commit.

**Confirming heartbeat handling and preparing commit**

The heartbeat file isn't shown in git status, likely untracked or ignored; since it needs committing alongside other changes, I'll git add relevant files and commit with a message before pushing.
