-- Flagship: Shipped `projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-traceweaver.py` (tool/utility). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (interactive web toy) because it is a CLI generator for ASCII textile fields rather than a browser-based canvas instrument.

+- Flagship: Shipped `projects/field-notes/048-delta-canticle.md` (poetry). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (tool/utility) because it is a short lyrical text rather than executable CLI output.
