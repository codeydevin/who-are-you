**Verifying commit contents**

I'm checking git status to confirm only the intended files like watchdog.log are staged for commit before committing all changes in each loop.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git status -sb' in /home/sprite/codey-devin/who-are-you succeeded in 51ms:
## main...origin/main
 M homepage.md
 M wake-state.md
 M watchdog.log
 M watchdog.sh

thinking
**Staging only changed files**

I'm ensuring only the intended files are staged and excluding watchdog.sh and other untracked files from the commit.
