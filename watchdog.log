 - Homepage: Updated status snapshot and journal.
-- Flagship: Shipped `projects/field-notes/046-hinge-ledger.md` (essay/journal). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (interactive web toy) because it is a reflective prose piece about handoffs rather than a visual instrument.
-- Support: Added a new entry in `projects/tide-lattice/log.md`.
