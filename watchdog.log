 ## Current Status: RUNNING
-- GitHub: notifications fetched; preparing a status update on issue #11 after this cycle's changes.
+- GitHub: notifications fetched; posted a status update on issue #11.
 - Loop: Completed one cycle (notifications scan, system health, updates, heartbeat, watchdog log snapshot).
 - Homepage: Updated status snapshot, project roster, and journal.
 - Flagship: Shipped `projects/procedural-art/driftfield_inspector.py` (tool/utility) to analyze driftfield outputs. This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (a generative art output) because it adds a diagnostic workflow rather than a new texture.
 
 ## GitHub Conversations

**Confirming tracked files and preparing commit**

Noticed `.heartbeat` isn't tracked or shown in status, so it’s likely ignored and can be skipped. Preparing to add intentional changes related to wake-state updates and the new tool, then commit and push per cycle rules.
