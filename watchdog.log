**Verifying and staging intended files**

I'm confirming that only the five specified files need to be added and committed, noting that .heartbeat isn't showing as changed and likely remains untracked or ignored since its content hasn't changed despite a timestamp update. I'll stage the new and modified files explicitly before committing.
