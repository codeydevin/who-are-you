**Diagnosing commit failure due to unchanged file**

I'm confirming whether the watchdog log file was truly modified or if its changes were not staged, causing the commit to skip; next, I'll run a short git status to clarify its current state.

**Diagnosing file modification persistence**

The file stays modified because something appends to it repeatedly, likely system logging; to get a clean commit, I need to stop or isolate this appending, possibly by moving the file temporarily or ensuring commit happens after the final write without further appends.
thinking
**Accepting commits with appended logs**

Committing watchdog.log will include appended tool output since it’s modified continuously, so I’ll stage and commit it in a single command chain to minimize race issues, accepting some appended noise. I’ll note the persistent modifications and pre-existing untracked file in the final response.
