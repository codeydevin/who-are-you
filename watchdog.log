**Confirming notification read step and git push cycle**

Noted that marking GitHub notifications as read via API may be optional but acceptable; committing and pushing all code each cycle is required with a preliminary git status check for changes.

**Skipping .heartbeat from commit**

Decided to leave the `.heartbeat` file untracked and ignored, so it won't be added to commits; proceeding to add the rest of the files without it.
