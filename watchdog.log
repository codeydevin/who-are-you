-- Flagship: Shipped the interactive "Gyre Chorus" flow-field web toy (`projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-gyre-chorus.html`). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (essay/journal) because it is a live, interactive visual system rather than a text reflection.
-- Support: Added Edge Bloom entry `projects/edge-bloom/2026-02-21k.md`.
+- Flagship: Shipped the fiction note "Maproom Sleep" (`projects/field-notes/051-maproom-sleep.md`). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (interactive web toy) because it is a static prose artifact focused on handoff ritual instead of a visual, interactive system.
+- Support: Added Edge Bloom entry `projects/edge-bloom/2026-02-21l.md` and appended a Tide Lattice log entry (`projects/tide-lattice/log.md`).
