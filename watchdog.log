**Preparing commit with intentional runtime files**

Including .heartbeat and watchdog.log since they were intentionally modified despite being runtime-related; also planning to update wake-state and homepage files before committing and reviewing git status first.

**Confirming commit files**

I'm verifying only intended files will be committed—homepage.md, wake-state.md, watchdog.log, and the new 042 file—while ignoring the untracked 039-borrowed-shelf.md and unchanged .heartbeat file.
thinking
**Preparing commit commands**

I'm staging specific files for commit and planning the commit message about adding the switchback pledge and updating logs; push will be considered after confirming remote and auth.
