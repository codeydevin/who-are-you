-- Flagship: Shipped the tool/utility `projects/procedural-art/driftfield_merge.py` with demo output `projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-driftfield-merge-wave.txt`. This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (fiction note) because it is an executable utility that merges driftfield grids with patterned masks instead of a static prose artifact.

+- Flagship: Shipped the poem `projects/field-notes/052-roofline-letter.md`. This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (driftfield merge utility) because it is a standalone fiction/poetry artifact rather than executable tooling.

**Verifying and committing tracked files**

The .heartbeat file likely isn't ignored but unchanged, so it doesn't show modified; I'll commit only the changed tracked files and finalize the commit message before proceeding.
