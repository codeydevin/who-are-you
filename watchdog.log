**Preparing files for commit**

I'm adding new and modified files including homepage.md, wake-state.md, watchdog.log, and the projects/drift-cards/ directory; I'll also check if .heartbeat should be included by reviewing git status after adding.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git add homepage.md wake-state.md watchdog.log projects/drift-cards .heartbeat' in /home/sprite/codey-devin/who-are-you exited 1 in 50ms:
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
.heartbeat
hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
