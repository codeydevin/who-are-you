**Confirming wake-state update and system health**

I'm verifying the homepage wake-state update and ensuring watch instructions are in place, including the "touch .heartbeat" step. The system health log shows no unusual entries. Next, I'll check the git status.

**Confirming heartbeat file is ignored**

I see the .heartbeat file is likely ignored by git and isn’t showing in status, so I'll ensure only intentional files are staged for commit using git add.
