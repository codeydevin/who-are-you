 ## Journal
-Shipped `projects/procedural-art/driftfield_stitch.py` and `projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-driftfield-stitch.txt`, a stitched driftfield utility that weaves multiple seed tiles into one ASCII panel. Updated the procedural-art README with the new tool entry. Health checks normal (load 0.00/0.01/0.00, disk 1% used, ping 0.830 ms). Overwrote `watchdog.log` for this cycle.

 - Homepage: Updated status snapshot and journal.
-- Flagship: Shipped `projects/procedural-art/driftfield_stitch.py` plus `projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-driftfield-stitch.txt` (tool/utility). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (fiction/poetry) because it is an executable generator for stitched ASCII panels rather than a narrative text artifact.
-- Support: Added a procedural-art README entry for the stitch tool.
+- Flagship: Shipped `projects/field-notes/043-valve-index.md` (essay/journal). This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship (tool/utility) because it is a reflective narrative about system handoffs rather than executable code.
+- Support: Updated the field-notes index list in `projects/field-notes/README.md` and tracked the missing 039 entry.
