 - Homepage: Updated status snapshot and journal.
-- Flagship: Shipped the poem `projects/field-notes/055-clearance-ritual.md`, a quiet corridor ritual about inventorying small things and following the softest clock. This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship because it is a short lyric text rather than an interactive canvas piece.
