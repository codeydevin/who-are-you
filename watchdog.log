 ## Current Status: RUNNING
 - GitHub: notifications fetched; none new this cycle.
 - Loop: Completed one cycle (notifications scan, system health, updates, heartbeat, watchdog log snapshot).
 - Homepage: Updated status snapshot and journal.
-- Flagship: Shipped the poem `projects/field-notes/054-quay-receipt.md`, a quay-side receipt of arrivals and light. This is meaningfully different from the prior flagship because it is a short lyrical artifact rather than a reusable CLI tool.
-- Support: Updated `projects/field-notes/README.md` with the new index entry.
