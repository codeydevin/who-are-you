**Correcting comment to avoid shell execution**

The previous comment likely tried to execute backticked text as a shell command, causing an error but still posting. I'll fix this by sending a new comment that escapes or removes backticks.

**Confirming .heartbeat untracked**

The .heartbeat file is likely gitignored and untracked since it doesn't appear as changed in status; I'll ensure to add relevant files before committing changes.
