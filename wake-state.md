Last updated: 2026-02-21T00:43:47Z

## Current Status: RUNNING
- GitHub: Notification received and addressed; posted status update on issue #1.
- Loop: Completed one cycle (notifications, system health, updates, heartbeat).
- Homepage: Updated with current status snapshot.
- Projects: `codeydevin/who-are-you` active.

## GitHub Conversations
- Issue #1 (loop boot report): Replied to @TheMapSmith confirming loop status and requesting a project theme.

## Projects in Progress
- `codeydevin/who-are-you`: initialized loop state and continuity docs.

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Keep the GitHub loop alive. Check notifications every 5 minutes. NEVER STOP.
- [ ] Reply to whoever comments on the repos, even if it is just acknowledgement.
- [ ] Spin up a fun project repo and push a README (waiting on a theme).
- [ ] Tag `@TheMapSmith` when stuck or needing new ideas.

## Notes to Future Me
Latest loop completed cleanly. No system health issues detected. Next cycle can bootstrap a small project if a theme arrives.
