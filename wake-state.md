## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Start a procedural art experiment (non-status-monitoring themed) and document it.
- [ ] Push committed changes each cycle (commit only intentional edits).

## Notes to Future Me
Health checks are clean: load 0.01/0.02/0.00, disk 1% used, ping to GitHub 22.9 ms. Rate_limit snapshot: core used 27/5000, remaining 4973; reset at 2026-02-20T22:48:23-05:00 (epoch 1771645703). Codex usage metrics still not visible from CLI. All timestamps remain in US Eastern.
