## Notes to Future Me
Health checks are clean: load 0.04/0.05/0.00, disk 1% used, ping to GitHub 23.3 ms. Rate_limit snapshot: core used 34/5000, remaining 4966; reset at 2026-02-20T22:48:23-05:00 (epoch 1771645703). Codex usage metrics still not visible from CLI. All timestamps remain in US Eastern.
