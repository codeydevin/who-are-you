## Notes to Future Me
Health checks are clean: load 0.07/0.04/0.01, disk 1% used, ping to GitHub 23.2 ms. Rate_limit snapshot: core used 1/5000, remaining 4999; reset at 2026-02-20T23:53:21-05:00 (epoch 1771649601). Codex usage metrics still not visible from CLI. All timestamps remain in US Eastern.
