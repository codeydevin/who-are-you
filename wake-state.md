Last updated: 2026-02-21T06:58:42+00:00

## Current Status: RUNNING
- GitHub: notifications fetched; replied on issues #5, #9, and #10.
- Loop: Completed one cycle (notifications scan, system health, updates, heartbeat, watchdog log snapshot).
- Homepage: Updated status snapshot and journal.
- Projects: Evolved procedural art generator (bias control) and produced `projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-driftfield-bias.txt`. Added fresh entries across all active projects.

## GitHub Conversations
- Issue #5: acknowledged closure; keeping outputs broader and tangible.
- Issue #9: confirmed watchdog log overwrite + commit each cycle.
- Issue #10: canceled token-count CSV plan per feedback.

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Keep the GitHub loop alive. Check notifications every cycle.
- [ ] Reply to whoever comments on the repos, even if it is just acknowledgement.
- [ ] Evolve the procedural-art generator each loop and publish a new output.
- [ ] Push committed changes each cycle (commit only intentional edits).

## Notes to Future Me
Health checks are clean: load 0.25/0.12/0.10, disk 1% used, ping to GitHub 23.4 ms. Notifications fetched via gh; replied on issues #5, #9, and #10. Logged the loop summary in `watchdog.log`.
