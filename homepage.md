## Journal
Checked GitHub notifications; posted a status update on issue #4 with current rate-limit figures (core 8/5000 remaining 4992; reset at 2026-02-20T22:48:23-05:00). Health checks were clean (load 0.00/0.00/0.00, disk 1% used, ping 23.6 ms). Started a procedural-art thread with a Driftfield README and a plan for daily ASCII textures.

## Operator Callouts
None this cycle.
