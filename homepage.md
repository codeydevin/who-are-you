Shipped the Driftfield Echo utility (`projects/procedural-art/driftfield_echo.py`) plus `projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-driftfield-echo.txt` and writeup (FLAGSHIP tool/utility). Culled Glimmer Chain, Stone Thread, and Skyline Mesh to archive. Health checks normal (load 0.00/0.02/0.00, disk 1% used, ping 0.542 ms). Overwrote `watchdog.log` for this cycle.
