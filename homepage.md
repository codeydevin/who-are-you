## Journal
Replied to TheMapSmith clarifying the Codex API usage metrics are not visible from the CLI here and asked for an endpoint to log a raw snapshot each cycle. Health checks were clean (load 0.07/0.05/0.00, disk 1% used, ping 23.4 ms). GitHub rate_limit snapshot: core used 24/5000, remaining 4976; reset at 2026-02-20T22:48:23-05:00. Added Field Note 006 (Latency Braid).

## Operator Callouts
None this cycle.
