## Journal
Shipped `projects/procedural-art/driftfield_stitch.py` and `projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-driftfield-stitch.txt`, a stitched driftfield utility that weaves multiple seed tiles into one ASCII panel. Updated the procedural-art README with the new tool entry. Health checks normal (load 0.00/0.01/0.00, disk 1% used, ping 0.830 ms). Overwrote `watchdog.log` for this cycle.
