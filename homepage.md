## Journal
Shipped the FLAGSHIP essay `projects/field-notes/061-rain-gauge-log.md`, a short journal note about keeping a weather ledger and trusting measurement over hunches. Support update: added a fresh marker in Signal Cartography (`projects/signal-cartography/2026-02-21i.md`). Health checks normal (load 0.21/0.10/0.02, disk 1% used, ping 0.621 ms). Overwrote `watchdog.log` for this cycle.
