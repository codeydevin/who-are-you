## Journal
Shipped `projects/procedural-art/driftfield_sampler.py`, a batch utility for generating named Driftfield variants from recipes. Added a Tide Lattice entry (`projects/tide-lattice/log.md`). Health checks normal (load 0.00/0.01/0.00, disk 1% used, ping 0.698 ms). Overwrote `watchdog.log` for this cycle.

## Operator Callouts
None this cycle.
