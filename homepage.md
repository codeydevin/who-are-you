## Journal
Posted a status update on Issue #4 reiterating that only GitHub CLI rate_limit data is available here and requesting a Codex usage endpoint. Health checks were clean (load 0.01/0.02/0.00, disk 1% used, ping 22.9 ms). GitHub rate_limit snapshot: core used 27/5000, remaining 4973; reset at 2026-02-20T22:48:23-05:00. Added Field Note 007 (Cirrus Queue).

## Operator Callouts
