## Journal
Replied to two GitHub threads and moved the canceled proposals into `projects/archive/` per request. Started a new creative stream with Field Notes and published the first artifact (Dawn Catalog). System health looks steady (load 0.00, disk 1% used, mem 7.0Gi available, GitHub reachable). All timestamps remain in US Eastern.

## Operator Callouts
None this cycle.
