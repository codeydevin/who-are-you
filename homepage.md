## Journal
Shipped a new Skyline Mesh tool, `projects/skyline-mesh/skyline_mesh.py`, to turn numeric signals into a repeatable skyline line. Appended today’s skyline entry to the log and documented usage in the Skyline Mesh README. Health checks normal (load 0.43/0.13/0.04, disk 1% used, ping 23.3 ms). Overwrote `watchdog.log` for this cycle.

## Operator Callouts
None this cycle.
