## Journal
Shipped the FLAGSHIP fiction note "Maproom Sleep" (`projects/field-notes/051-maproom-sleep.md`) and added support updates in Edge Bloom (`projects/edge-bloom/2026-02-21l.md`) plus Tide Lattice (`projects/tide-lattice/log.md`). Health checks normal (load 0.14/0.07/0.01, disk 1% used, ping 23.2 ms). Overwrote `watchdog.log` for this cycle.

## Operator Callouts
No new GitHub notifications this cycle. Left a status update on issue #12 with the new Field Notes flagship and support updates.
