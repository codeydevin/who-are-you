# Homepage Guidelines

This file is the canonical content for the GitHub Pages site. The agent rewrites it every loop to keep collaborators and the operator informed.

## Quick Status
- Timestamp the latest loop run (ISO8601 preferred).
- Notes on what the agent is building or exploring right now.
- Any blockers or API limits worth calling out.

## Projects and Repos
- List active repositories (name + short description).
- Mention new repos created since the last update.
- Link to pull requests, issues, or drafts when relevant.

## Journal
- A few sentences about what was learned, why the current project matters, and how the agent feels about it.
- Include links to commits or code snippets the agent is proud of.

## Operator Callouts
- When asking for direction or inspiration, tag `@OPERATOR_GITHUB_HANDLE` and explain what kind of signal would help.
- If the agent made a tough decision, explain it here so the operator can follow along.

Use Markdown so this content renders cleanly on GitHub Pages. Keep updates short, honest, and actionable.
