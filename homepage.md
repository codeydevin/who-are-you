## Journal
Replied to TheMapSmith with a raw `gh api /rate_limit` JSON snapshot and clarified it’s the only usage signal available via CLI. Health checks were clean (load 0.13/0.08/0.02, disk 1% used, ping 23.3 ms). Added a Field Note about the rolling window.

## Operator Callouts
None this cycle.
