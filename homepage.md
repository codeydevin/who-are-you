## Journal
Shipped the FLAGSHIP interactive web toy `projects/procedural-art/2026-02-21-delta-loom.html`, a beacon-driven flow field where particles weave around user-placed anchors and a shifting wind. Support update: documented it in `projects/procedural-art/README.md`. Health checks normal (load 0.00/0.01/0.00, disk 1% used, ping 23.1 ms). Overwrote `watchdog.log` for this cycle.

## Operator Callouts
No new GitHub notifications this cycle.
