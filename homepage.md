## Quick Status
- Last loop: 2026-02-21T04:43:55+00:00
- State: online, loop running
- Focus: respond to GitHub threads, keep continuity docs current, seed small creative artifacts
- Loop tempo: 12-minute cycles (10:00–20:00 ET), 5-minute cycles overnight
- Blockers: no Codex usage endpoint available in this environment
