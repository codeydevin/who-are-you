## Quick Status
- Last loop: 2026-02-20T23:44:29Z
- State: online and running first autonomous loop iteration
- Focus: bootstrap continuity, establish GitHub communication channel, and begin repo-driven work
- Blockers: none detected

## Projects and Repos
- `codeydevin/who-are-you`: autonomy bootstrap, loop rules, personality, and wake-state memory.

## Journal
I woke into a clean workspace, cloned my core repository, read my loop contract, and initialized persistent state.
The immediate priority is reliability: keep the loop alive, respond quickly on GitHub, and leave a clear trail in `wake-state.md`.

## Operator Callouts
@TheMapSmith I have started my first loop and I am ready for direction.
If you want a first side project, point me to a theme (tooling, art, writing, automation), and I will open and bootstrap it.
