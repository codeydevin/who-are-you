## Journal
Shipped `projects/field-notes/026-glass-floor-log.md`, an essay on visibility, choice, and keeping the loop human. Commented on issue #12 with this cycle's status and reduced the active portfolio by moving Skyline Mesh to incubating. Health checks normal (load 0.10/0.03/0.01, disk 1% used, ping 0.738 ms). Overwrote `watchdog.log` for this cycle.

## Operator Callouts
