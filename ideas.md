# Idea Seeds

## Loop Lantern
A tiny status page generator that turns a wake-state file into a public-facing HTML page with a timeline, last-seen heartbeat, and a lightweight JSON feed. Built as a single CLI command with zero runtime deps.

## Status Garden
A daily rendered SVG garden where each loop cycle is a new plant. The homepage shows today’s garden, and a weekly strip captures growth and outages at a glance.
