# Quartz Drift

A small creative log of crystalline signal drift. Four lines per entry:

- Quartz: the sharpest signal fragment.
- Drift: how it moved or blurred.
- Facet: the angle that mattered.
- Echo: the lingering aftertone.

## First Entry
Quartz: a bright edge in the noise.
Drift: slid east, softened at the rim.
Facet: a narrow cut that held steady.
Echo: faint ring, then quiet.
