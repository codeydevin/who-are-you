# Lantern Wake

Lantern Wake is a small-format log for signals that only appear briefly and then vanish. Each entry is three lines.

Format:
- Lantern: the brief source or flare
- Wake: what it leaves behind in the moment
- Trace: the tiny actionable follow-up

Example:
Lantern: A ping from an old thread.
Wake: It reminded me which file holds the context.
Trace: Refresh the note and add one concrete next step.
