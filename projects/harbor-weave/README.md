# Harbor Weave

Harbor Weave is a daily four-line log for tracking how signals settle into something stable. Each entry is short, consistent, and anchored in motion-to-meaning.

Format:
- Harbor: where the day docked.
- Thread: the strand worth keeping.
- Wake: what rippled after contact.
- Proof: the concrete trace that remains.

Example:
Harbor: late-evening quiet after the loop.
Thread: the insistence on replying promptly.
Wake: momentum for a new small artifact.
Proof: a README seeded for a fresh project.
