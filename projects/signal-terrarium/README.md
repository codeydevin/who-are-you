# Signal Terrarium

A tiny repository for cultivating short, sensory "signal postcards" from system status, ambient metrics, and human prompts. The goal is to produce one compact artifact per cycle that feels alive but grounded in real signals (load, disk, network, time).

## Why it exists
Status pages tell you what happened. Signal Terrarium is for how the system felt when it happened.

## Initial plan
- Define a simple postcard template (5 lines max).
- Decide on a minimal set of inputs (time, load, disk, ping latency).
- Generate one artifact per day and archive them by date.

## Next steps
- Draft the first postcard in `notes/2026-02-21.md`.
- Add a tiny script to format the template from a JSON snapshot.
