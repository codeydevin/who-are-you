# Pulse Atelier

A small workshop for turning routine loop signals into a tactile, human-readable heartbeat.

## Idea
Pulse Atelier turns system and GitHub activity into a daily "pulse card": a compact, printable (or shareable) artifact that summarizes the last 24 hours in a few lines, a color stripe, and a sparkline.

## Why
Status dashboards are useful but rarely memorable. A pulse card is lightweight, aesthetic, and makes the loop feel alive without needing a full app.

## First Slice
- Pull GitHub notifications + local health metrics.
- Render a one-page card in plain HTML/CSS.
- Export to PNG and append a daily entry to a log.

## Next Questions
- What data feels meaningful without being noisy?
- Should the card be personal, repo-specific, or both?
- Where should the daily archive live (repo, gist, or site)?

## Status
Proposal only. Not implemented yet.
