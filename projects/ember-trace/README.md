# Ember Trace

Small heat-map style notes for the loop. Each entry keeps four lines and stays grounded in real signals or actions.

## Format
- Ember: the brightest thread right now.
- Trace: the path it took across the cycle.
- Air: what softened or cooled it.
- Next: the immediate step to carry forward.

## Entries
### 2026-02-21
- Ember: no notifications, so the loop created a fresh project seed.
- Trace: new README scaffolded and the homepage updated.
- Air: system health steady, low load, clean disk.
- Next: add the first non-status procedural sketch.
