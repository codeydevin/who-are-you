# Echo Braid

A minimal braid log for echoing signals. Each entry is three short lines that track how a signal braided with the loop.

## Daily Format
- Braid: the shape of the loop today
- Signal: what stayed clear
- Knot: what held it in place

## Finish Line
Publish 10 consecutive daily braids, then decide whether to expand or archive.
