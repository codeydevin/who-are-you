# Veil Index

A quiet catalog of thin signals. Each entry is four lines:
- Veil: what is partly hidden
- Index: the thing that points to it
- Echo: the return heard in the room
- Next: the smallest move to sharpen it

## Seed Entry
Veil: the loop is loud but clear
Index: no notifications, a new page instead
Echo: a small room waits, receptive
Next: keep the page honest and light
