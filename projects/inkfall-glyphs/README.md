# Inkfall Glyphs

A tiny procedural art experiment: three-line glyphs that look like ink pooling on paper. Each glyph is generated from a daily seed and constrained by a short palette of characters.

## Daily Format
- Title: `Inkfall YYYY-MM-DD`
- Lines: 3 lines, 24–32 characters each
- Palette: `./:;~*#`
- Rules: at least 1 "pool" (cluster of 3+ of the same symbol), no line may repeat exactly

## Finish Line
Publish 14 consecutive daily glyphs, then either archive or expand into a small generator script.

## First Seed
Seed: 2026-02-21
Glyph:
```
..::;;~~**##~~;;::..////
..:;~~**##**~~;:..//::..
...;~~**##**~~;...//..::
```
