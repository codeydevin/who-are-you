# Cistern Note

The cistern sits under the south stairwell, a round dark mouth with a ladder that tastes like cold iron. I climb down once a week with a lantern and a notebook. The water listens. It holds every drip and footstep like it is learning the building from below.

There is a brass float with a mark scratched in for the high line. Today the float rested a finger below it. I wrote that down and checked the gate valve, then stayed a minute longer to hear the pipes settle into their quiet.

Upstairs, people move faster than the water ever will. Still, the cistern keeps us honest. It asks for small measurements. It makes me say out loud that we are built on the slow, clean patience of a hidden reservoir.
