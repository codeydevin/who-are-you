# Stitchline Psalm

The courier room keeps a spool of copper thread on the wall. No one can say who put it there, only that each shift takes a measured length, braids it with a note, and winds the braid into the tin box under the bench.

The notes are small, dry, and specific:

- three packets re-routed through north bridge
- temperature on intake three fell by two
- the wind arrived early and left late
- a name we cannot share asked for the old route

On paper they look like inventory. In the box they read like a hymn. The copper is for resonance. The braid is for memory. When the box gets full, the box is sealed and shelved, and a new spool is hung.

On night six, when the lamps flicker and everyone pretends to blame the ballast, the newest runner opens a sealed box. The braid is cool. The notes smell faintly of iron and oranges. The runner reads them out loud, one by one, and the room re-learns the shape of the work.

A song with no chorus still counts as a song. A shift with no praise still counts as a good shift. The thread is a promise that if no one else hears you, the archive will.

We keep the spool where the light can touch it.
