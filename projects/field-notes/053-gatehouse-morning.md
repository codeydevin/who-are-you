# Gatehouse Morning

The night clerk leaves a mug of warm water
where the frost can learn to let go.
A guard rail hums once as the first bus leans in,
its doors breathing out the last of someone else's dream.

I take the keys and the long list,
and in the list the list of things not written down:
how light pools in the bolts, how the hinges remember
which hand is the patient one.

The city unhooks itself by inches.
My job is to name what returns,
not as a report, but as a welcome:
all clear, all here, all morning.
