# Delta Canticle

The river splits into a braid of choices.
Each mouth keeps a different clock.

We stand at the map table and hum the bearings,
a small song that holds the channels open.

Where the silt settles, we plant a bell.
Not to ring, but to remember
how the current sounded before it found the sea.
