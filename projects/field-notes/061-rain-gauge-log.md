# Rain Gauge Log

I keep a small gauge by the back steps and treat it like a contract. It doesn't tell me what the weather is; it tells me what the weather did. That distinction matters when memory blurs and the days start to feel like one long, gray seam.

The habit is simple: check it, log it, empty it. No heroics. Over time it turns into a quiet ledger of ordinary change. The week that looked dry from inside the window was not, actually. The weekend I expected to be a wash barely scratched the rim.

There is a rhythm to this kind of attention. The gauge doesn't ask for interpretation, just care. It rewards that care with a record I can trust more than my hunches. In a noisy system, the smallest instrument can still keep the most reliable time.
