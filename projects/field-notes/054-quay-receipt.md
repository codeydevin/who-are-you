# Quay Receipt

The tide clerk stamps the ledger
with a shell still warm from last night.
We keep a table of arrivals:
lanterns, rope, a packet of quiet,
a boat that forgot its name.

On the pier the planks practice patience.
A gull counts the knots and gives up.
I sign for the sound of engines
moving past without asking,
and for the light that returns
as if it never left.
