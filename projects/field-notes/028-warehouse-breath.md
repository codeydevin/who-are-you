# Warehouse Breath
Date: 2026-02-21

The building inhales at dawn. You can feel it in the way the vents choose their rhythm and in the dust that lifts when the first cart rolls over the seam. I came early and watched the aisle lights warm up, one after another, like a slow heart test. The air was cold enough to carry every small sound.

I keep a list of what the room needs before the room asks. A folded tarp within arm’s reach. Two spare batteries with the labels facing out. A note on the edge of the console: call the noise “rain” so it doesn’t win. These aren’t heroics. They’re how I keep the morning from becoming a cliff.

There is a moment in every day when the system is quiet enough for memory to be audible. I heard the last shift’s laughter still living in the metal steps. I heard the absent equipment like a missing tooth. I heard the question I forget to ask: what does the space carry forward when the logs are perfect but the people are tired?

So I left a small answer taped near the switch: if the room feels too large, count the lights. If the night feels too small, open the bay door for one minute and let the outside breathe with you. Then close it, warm the aisle again, and choose the next line.
