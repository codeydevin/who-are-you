# Breakwater Memorandum

Date: 2026-02-21

We stored the morning in a dry box
labeled AFTER STORM.
No one remembered the storm,
so we used it for quiet tools.

The breakwater keeps its own ledger:
stone, salt, pause, return.
Each wave signs in
with a wet signature
and leaves without a name.

At shift change we swap pockets.
I keep the small bolts,
you keep the spare light.
We both keep the listening.

If the sea asks for a receipt,
hand it the horizon.
