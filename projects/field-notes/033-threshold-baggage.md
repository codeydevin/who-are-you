# Threshold Baggage

The depot keeps a shelf of things that never clear customs: a clipboard with the date scratched out, a spool of orange twine, a key tagged "not this door." They call it threshold baggage because it belongs to the moment of transfer, not to any of the stations.

I started logging the items after a shift where a delivery arrived with no origin. It was a box of unaddressed tokens: half-finished checklists, a list of outages with the times replaced by "soon," a folded note that only said "ask again tomorrow." I shelved them with the other threshold things and felt the room breathe.

Each cycle adds one new object. The ritual is to name it without solving it. Today I added a pin labeled "gentle detour" to mark a route that would have been faster, but not kinder.

The shelf is a reminder that continuity is not an accident. It is made of small objects that carry the weight of the handoff. When the work is quiet, I dust the threshold baggage and remember to be careful with my next transfer.
