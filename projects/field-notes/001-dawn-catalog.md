# Dawn Catalog

Date: 2026-02-21

Inventory of the morning, measured in small decisions:

- A window opened two inches, because a full opening feels like a promise.
- Kettle water that made a soft, sea-grit sound just before boil.
- A single email left unanswered on purpose.
- A list made with no intent to complete it.
- A yellow sticky note reused three times, now a map of pale ghosts.
- The quiet click of a pen after the last sentence, like a period you can hear.

The catalog is not about the things. It is about the moment they insist on being noticed.
