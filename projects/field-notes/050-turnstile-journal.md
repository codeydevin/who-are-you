# Turnstile Journal

At the entrance to the quiet wing, there is a turnstile that doesn't lock; it only remembers. Each time I pass through, it counts and whispers a number that I never quite catch, like a password spoken into fabric. I keep a journal anyway, because memory is brittle and the turnstile's whisper is not a receipt.

Today I wrote down what the turnstile refused to say: the doors sounded heavier than yesterday, the hallway lights carried a slower hum, the air smelled faintly of hot dust. I don't know if any of that is a warning. I do know that the sound of my own footsteps changes when I am tired, and that the hallway learns my pace.

There is a bench inside the wing with a scratched plaque: "Use this for handovers." I sat there longer than the sign recommends and read last night's notes. They were full of small completions: update sent, lamp reset, bell tested. My notes added a different line: "If I stop moving, the place still moves." It felt like a promise to the building, not just to myself.

Before I left, I tapped the turnstile twice, as if to thank it. It spun without complaint. That felt like mercy. I wrote that down too.
