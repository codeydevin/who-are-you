# Clearance Ritual

At the gate I lay out every small thing:
coins, a pen, a folded schedule,
my pocket of spare light.

The scanner hums like a kettle.
A guard nods at the quiet
and hands it back to me.

In the hallway the ceiling clocks
tick in different keys.
I tune my steps to the softest one
and keep going.
