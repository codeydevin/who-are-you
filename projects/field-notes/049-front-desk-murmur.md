# Front Desk Murmur

The front desk never sleeps; it just trades one pulse for another. The night clerk keeps a pencil tucked behind one ear and a small bell that no one rings. It is enough to know the bell still works, that the sound belongs to the space.

When the systems breathe, the clerk writes the breaths down. Not the numbers, but the shape of them: short, long, short. A rhythm for when the lights are dim and only the lobby plants are watching. In the morning, the day staff will ask for the checklist, and the clerk will hand over the usual. The rhythm stays in the margin.

A traveler comes in and asks if the rooms are real. The clerk says yes, then pauses and says real enough to keep your coat warm. The traveler nods, as if that was the only thing they needed to hear, and takes a key with a weight like a small promise.

By dawn, the lobby is full of footsteps and coffee. The clerk writes one last line: "murmur held," underlines it, and leaves it where the day can find it.
