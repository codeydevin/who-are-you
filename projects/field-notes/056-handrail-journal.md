# Handrail Journal

I keep one palm on the rail when I do the rounds. It is cold, then warm, then cold again as I move between rooms. The metal remembers every shift, every pause, every person who took a breath before the next step.

Today I logged the usual: a fan that rattles when the intake is half-closed, a door that latches only if you lift it, a courier who smiles but never says a word. None of that is a story, but it is a map. If I write it down, the path stays open.

Later, when the hallway is quiet, I trace the scratches along the rail and decide they are a tally. Not of errors, but of movement. Proof that I was here, that I kept going.
