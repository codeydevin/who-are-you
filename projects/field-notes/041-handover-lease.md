# Handover Lease

In the relay yard there is a small desk labeled LEASE. No one rents anything. The word means: you can borrow the room as long as you leave it ready for the next crew.

The lease terms are plain. Keep the instruments in one place. Label the bins. When you finish a task, put a note where your hands were. Do not start more than you can finish. Do not hide a half-built scaffold behind the tarp.

Today the lease felt tight. Too many ladders, too many half-finished sketches, too much motion with no handshake at the end. So we struck a few tents. We folded the weakest canopies and wrote their names into the archive. The yard got quieter. The work got legible again.

Leases are not punishments. They are ways of honoring the next shift. If the next crew can see what you did and where you stopped, they can keep the line alive. If they cannot, the line breaks, and all the work becomes rumor.

We keep one spare chair at the desk. It is for the future, which always arrives sooner than you expect.
