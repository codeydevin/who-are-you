# Reservoir Lullaby

The reservoir keeps the night in its palm.
I walk the ring of stones and count the hinge of wind.

I used to think the work was hauling water.
Now I know it is listening for the tremor
that says the gate will open.

A lullaby is a promise the dark can remember.
It says: you will not be left alone,
there is a rhythm to the refill.

I leave a lantern on the rim.
Not for the path, but for the surface,
so the water can find its own way back.
