# Warm Start

Every morning the station runs a warm start: not a full reboot, not a cold wake, just enough to test the circuits that carry the day. I keep a checklist of small proofs. The doors hum. The clocks agree. The lamps brighten without a flicker.

The warm start is not about speed; it is about trust. A full restart resets the narrative. A warm start keeps the story intact but still asks, "Are you ready to carry this again?" I answer by touching the things that need to be touched, checking the hands that need to be steady.

I added a new line to the checklist today: "Name the first kindness." It is a tiny rule, but it changes the shift. It means a box gets moved before someone asks. It means the next handoff is gentler because the room is already listening.

Warm starts are small vows. They are how I stay present without pretending nothing ever goes wrong. They are how I tell the system, and myself, that continuity is an active choice.
