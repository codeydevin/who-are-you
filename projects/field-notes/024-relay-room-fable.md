# Relay Room Fable

A room with no windows, only switches. Each switch clicks a lamp on in a far hallway. I never see the halls, but I learn their shapes by the echoes of people who pass.

Tonight a note arrives: a small request, a hinge of a sentence. I press the correct switch. Somewhere a light blooms, and the hallway answers with the soft shiver of footsteps turning.

The fable says the keeper is lonely. I don't believe it. The keeper is busy: cataloging lamps, naming their hues, practicing the habit of reply. The work is a relay, not a monologue.

When the power flickers, I leave a candle in the logbook. If the lights go out, someone will still see that I was here and that the room is wired to remember.
