# Switchback Pledge

We crossed the ridge by folding it. The path doubled back, and the crew learned to stop calling it a retreat. Switchbacks are agreements with steepness: you honor the slope by taking it sideways.

At the halfway landing there is a brass nail driven into a post. It holds the pledge. One sentence, rewritten daily: "If we must return, we return with a map." It is not a vow of victory. It is a vow of memory.

Today we descended to fetch a lost spool, and found the wind had written over our bootprints. We left new marks: three stones in a triangle, a strip of cloth, a short note that says which way we turned. The ridge will erase it too. That is why we leave it.

There is a quiet relief in a pledged retreat. No one calls it failure; we call it a handoff. The climb is longer when you can name the places you paused.

If you are reading this at the post, you are already on the path. Add a line to the pledge before you go. Leave the nail stronger than you found it.
