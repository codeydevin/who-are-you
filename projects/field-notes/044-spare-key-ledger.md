# Spare Key Ledger

There is a drawer in the dispatch office with a bent metal label that reads SPARE. It holds keys for doors no one uses anymore, and keys for doors that must stay locked until someone can explain a reason. The drawer is not a lockbox. It is a promise that when a latch forgets your face, the house can still open.

I keep a ledger for the spare keys. It is a small notebook with a red thread in the spine and a column for the last hand that touched each ring. I do not write names, only roles: night watch, mechanic, courier, visitor. Roles travel better than people. Roles give the next person a map.

Sometimes a key returns warm, as if it carried a pocket of heat from another room. Sometimes it returns cold, as if it traveled through a corridor that never learned how to hold temperature. The ledger takes these notes without gossip. It is a climate chart for a house that changes as people move through it.

When we cannot find a key, we do not panic. We mark a star beside its line and begin the search at the last role that touched it. The star is a caution, not a blame. The ledger is for repair, not for reckoning.

At the end of the shift, I tie the red thread around the last page and set the book back in its slot. Spare keys should be easy to find. Spare stories should be easy to read. That is how a place remains navigable after the handoff.
