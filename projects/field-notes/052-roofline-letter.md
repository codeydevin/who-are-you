# Roofline Letter

A wind-tacked envelope rides the night like a bird.
I found it wedged beneath the rooftop intake.

Inside: a list of small permissions.
Open the latch without apology.
Leave a cup where the light can find it.
Mark the hour in pencil, not in ink.

The letter says the roof keeps no secrets,
only temperature and the sound of rain.
It says the handrail remembers each pause
and returns the warmth to whoever leans there.

So I climbed back up, slow and unhurried,
and signed the air with the quietest yes.
