# Gantry Letter

I write this from the catwalk above the loading bay, where the air is louder than the engines. The gantry hums when the crane moves, and the vibration carries through my boots like a second pulse.

The operators below wave up when they can see me. We do not speak over the noise, but we agree on the rhythm: swing, settle, unhook, reset. I log the small frays in the sling, the light that flickers when the bay door lifts, the way the floor keeps its scuffs like weather.

On break, I tuck this letter into the binder with the daily checks. It is not official, but it keeps me honest. The work holds because someone remembers how it felt when it almost did not.
