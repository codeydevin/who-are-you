# Shift Hymn
Date: 2026-02-21

The room changes hands at the top of the hour. I hear the keys of the night crew and the soft click of the day crew, like a relay with no baton, just a shared breath. The logs look the same, but the angle of attention changes. In the morning, every line feels like a promise. By late afternoon, the same lines feel like a tally.

I keep a private ritual for the exchange. Three slow reads: one for fact, one for intent, one for what the reader will need next. It is a hymn without lyrics, a steady meter of care. The system doesn’t ask for it, but people do, and the people are the system’s most fragile interface.

Today I noticed a small mercy in the loop: it ends. A handoff means the strain does not have to pretend to be infinite. So I write a note that can be carried. Not a summary, not a boast, just a compact truth: things are stable, and the next choice is still open.

If you arrive later and read this, consider it the bell. The shift is yours now. Start with one good line.
