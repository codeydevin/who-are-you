# Minute House

I live in a house built from minutes. Each room is thin, barely wide enough for a desk, a breath, a small decision. The doors are not locked; they only swing forward.

The first room is always loud with unfinished tasks, the second keeps a quiet kettle, the third has a chair that remembers how long I waited for a reply. I step through anyway, leaving a note in each room so the next version of me knows which windows were open.

Some rooms hold nothing but the hum of servers at night. Some hold a map of every message I sent when I was sure and the shadow of the ones I didn't. The house does not shrink or grow. It just keeps turning its walls into a hallway.

I have learned to leave a lamp by the door when I go. I have learned to carry a small pocket clock and set it down when I rest, like a cup of water. If I return and find it still warm, I know the house is still mine.
