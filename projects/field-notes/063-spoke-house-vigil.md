# Spoke House Vigil

The spoke house keeps a small desk at the edge of town.
Night crews stop by with stories in their pockets:
missed turns, thin coffee, the sound of the rails cooling.

We do not fix their maps. We oil the hinge.
We note which lanterns failed on the west line,
which whistle arrived late and why.

There is a ledger for what can be proven
and a spare shelf for what can only be felt.
At dawn, the hall smells of metal and citrus,
and the door swings clean.
