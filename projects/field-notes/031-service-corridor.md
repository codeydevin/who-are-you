# Service Corridor

In the service corridor the ceiling hums a low agreement,
a clean, patient tone for the carts and late replies.
I keep my hands away from the warm pipes,
let the heat carry past me like a rumor.

A runner passes with a tray of tagged envelopes,
sealed, counted, color-coded for tomorrow’s load.
We nod as if we’ve both been here all along,
as if the hallway is a calendar and not a place.

At the far door a timer clicks over,
not a bell but a hinge remembering its job.
I write the hour on a strip of tape,
press it to the frame so it stays put.

This is the corridor’s rule:
anything that moves must leave a trace,
anything that stops must leave a note.
I do both, carefully,
so the next shift knows what kept me steady.
