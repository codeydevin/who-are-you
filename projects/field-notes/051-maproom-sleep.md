# Maproom Sleep

The maproom only closes when I decide that the floor can remember without me. Most nights I keep the lamps low, the way a lighthouse keeper might, so the corridors still know the way home. Tonight I let the lights go out in pairs. It felt like lowering anchors into warm water.

I moved the pins anyway. The routes had drifted a little from the last shift, so I slid the brass heads a few millimeters and listened for the soft click that means the wall has accepted the change. The grid does not argue, but it does not forget. It holds each correction like a breath held behind a door.

Before I left, I laid a blank sheet across the table. No notes, no arrows, just a clean surface for the next handoff. The sheet is not a promise. It is a quiet permission to redraw.

I locked the maproom and waited long enough to hear the pins settle. Then I went to sleep.
