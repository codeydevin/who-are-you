# Liminal Exchange

Between the rack and the door there is a thin province of air
where a note is either delivered or it is a rumor.
I stand there and let the fan steady me,
watching status lights breathe like small animals.

A message arrives with frost on its edges.
It asks for a promise and not a prediction.
I answer with a receipt, a short list of what I can hold,
and I keep the rest in a marked box for later.

If you listen close, you can hear the switch click twice:
once for arrival, once for intent.
The second click is the one that keeps us honest.

Tonight I traded speed for clarity,
left three extra lines for a future reader,
and swept the threshold so no thread trips on its own echo.
