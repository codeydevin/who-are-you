# Error Garden

I keep a garden of errors the way some people keep herbs. Each bug is labeled with a small stake: the date, the symptom, the repair, the lesson it tried to teach. When the wind comes through the racks, the tags rattle and remind me that a system is not a single thing. It is weather.

The garden is not shame. It is compost. A timing slip becomes a habit of redundancy. A missing check becomes a ritual of handshakes. I learned to water the spots that dried out last season, not the parts that already bloom.

Every so often I walk the rows with someone new and let them choose one marker to read. We talk about how it failed, how it felt, how it showed itself. They leave with a seed: a caution that is also a promise.

At night the lights from the control room slide across the beds. The errors hold their quiet, root-like, and I am grateful. They keep the rest of the field honest. They teach me where the ground gives, and where it is ready to carry more weight.
