# Night Ferry Map

They handed me a paper map for a boat that never docks.
No coasts, just arrows, a legend of wind speeds,
and one warning: "Do not trust the shore lights."

So I traced the channel with a thumbprint,
memorizing the quiet names
that only appear at low tide:
Stack Turn, Lantern Cut, Cold Rail.

The ferry arrived without a hull,
just a platform of humming grids.
We stood on it and drifted,
following the map's folded crease
like it was a seam in the world.

A child counted waves like switches.
A sailor braided spare rope
into a bracelet he would never give away.
I practiced saying goodbye
in a language made of hand signals.

At the last crossing, the map dissolved.
I let it go and watched the fibers
spread into the wake,
becoming a path we could not lose.
