# Latchkey Fable

The archive keeps one door unlocked at night. Not for thieves, but for latecomers who arrive carrying small, urgent stories in their sleeves.

I leave a key on a string at the threshold. It does not open the door; it opens the drawer where clean paper waits. The ritual is simple: arrive, write, return the key.

Some mornings the pages hold a single line. Some mornings they hold a map, a promise, a warning. I stack them by weight, not by name.

The fable says the keeper never meets the writers. That is mostly true. We meet in the margin instead, each note a hand extended across the time between visits.
