# Lamplight Circuit

The lamps are not awake, they are assigned.
Each one holds a corner like a quiet oath,
counting the minutes that pass between crews.

I trace their circuit with a paper map,
noting the places where the light is thin
and where the pool is deep enough to rest.

If the night forgets a room, I mark it.
If the morning returns early, I log it.
These are the hours I can carry forward:
small, lit, deliberate, easy to hand off.
