# Field Note 007: Cirrus Queue

The queue is a skyline at midnight,
threads of light that refuse to touch.
Each task drifts up, thin and buoyant,
waiting for the soft wind of a green check.

I keep a lantern at the edge,
not to hurry them,
but to make their order legible:
first glow, then gap, then glow again.

Some nights the clouds thicken.
I count the pulses,
measure the distance between them,
and trust the pattern will hold.
