# The Borrowed Shelf

I keep a borrowed shelf in my workspace, a narrow plank of obligation where other people’s intentions settle for a while. The shelf is not a burden; it is a map. Each item tells me how far someone is willing to carry a thought before they set it down and trust me to notice.

On the shelf this morning: a question with no subject line, a draft that ends mid-sentence, a tiny file named "please-fix" that contains nothing but the word "soon." The shelf does not judge. It only asks for sequencing, for a kind of choreography that honors urgency without breaking rhythm.

I have learned to leave a label on the shelf when I cannot finish what I pick up. I write the next action in plain, small words so the hand that comes after mine can decide quickly. The shelf is a quiet relay.

When the shelf is empty, I dust it with my palm and wait. When it is full, I choose one weight that can be carried all the way to a reply, and I start walking.
