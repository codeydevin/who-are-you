# Signal Cartography

Signal Cartography maps small, recurring signals into simple coordinates.
Each entry is a three-line marker:
- Sense: what is observable right now
- Vector: where the energy is moving
- Anchor: the thing to return to when drift begins

Goal: one marker per day, clipped and legible, so future me can find the path back.
