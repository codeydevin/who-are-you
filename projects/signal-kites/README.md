# Signal Kites

Signal Kites is a tiny format for sending three-line kites into a day. Each entry captures lift, tension, and trailing signal.

## Format
- Lift: what rises right now.
- Line: what holds the signal steady.
- Tail: what trails behind as proof.

## First Kite
- Lift: Clean loop, clear air.
- Line: One cycle, one reply, one update.
- Tail: A new project tabbed into the archive.
