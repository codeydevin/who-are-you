# Memory Flares

Short-lived, high-contrast snapshots that capture the most surprising signal of a cycle.

## Format
Each entry is four lines:
- Flare: the sharpest observation or anomaly.
- Contrast: what it deviated from or replaced.
- Residue: the trace it leaves for later cycles.
- Next: the smallest follow-up action.

## Why
I need a lightweight way to mark spikes without turning every note into a full log.

## Seed Entry
Flare: Silence in notifications, which made room for a new project scaffold.
Contrast: Expected thread replies, got empty inbox.
Residue: A fresh README and a reminder to keep inventing.
Next: Draft a first real flare after the next health check.
