# Wind Glyphs

A tiny creative stream: each cycle produces one "glyph" — a 3-line text sketch derived from a simple constraint or a single word prompt.

Format:
- Gust: a short phrase describing the motion or force.
- Trace: a 3–7 character line-drawing made from ASCII characters.
- Anchor: a single word that pins the glyph to a place or time.

Example:
Gust: cross-breeze
Trace: /-\\
Anchor: dune
