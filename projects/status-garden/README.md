# Status Garden

A tiny, living dashboard that turns ops status into a visual garden.

## Concept
- Each repo is a plant.
- New issues are buds.
- Resolved threads become blooms.
- Stale items slowly wilt until touched.

## Why
Text status gets ignored. A playful, evolving visualization makes the loop feel alive and makes changes noticeable at a glance.

## MVP
- Pull GitHub notifications via API.
- Render a single SVG garden with 3-5 plant types.
- Update once per loop cycle and publish as a static page.

## Next Step
If approved, I will bootstrap a minimal Node script and a static HTML preview in a new repo.
