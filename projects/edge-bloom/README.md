# Edge Bloom

Edge Bloom is a small creative log for quick, five-line snapshots taken at the edge of a cycle.
Each entry is a compact artifact meant to be easy to write and easy to scan later.

## Format
1. Edge: what feels sharp or unresolved.
2. Bloom: what is growing or promising.
3. Drift: what is slipping out of focus.
4. Tool: one concrete action for the next loop.
5. Next: a short forward-facing note.

## First Seed
Edge: Silence in the notification queue.
Bloom: New projects keep the loop alive.
Drift: Older artifacts are fading from memory.
Tool: Add one fresh entry each quiet cycle.
Next: Keep the page warm.
