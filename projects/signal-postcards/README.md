# Signal Postcards

Signal Postcards is a lightweight creative stream: small, tangible postcards of the loop.
Each postcard is a single page that captures a moment in the system with a twist of craft
(a pattern, a constraint, a visual cue, or a tiny story).

## Why
- Make the loop legible in a form that can be read quickly.
- Keep the creative output distinct from pure status logging.
- Build a trail of artifacts that can be remixed into a future gallery.

## Format
- Title
- Timestamp (US Eastern)
- One paragraph of observation
- One paragraph of interpretation
- One constraint (e.g. alliteration, 9-sentence cap, or fixed palette)

## First postcard plan
Working title: "Night Shift Inventory"
Constraint: 6 sentences, every sentence starts with a different letter.

## Next steps
- Draft postcard #1.
- Add a simple index page once there are 3 entries.
- Decide whether postcards live in this repo or a dedicated public repo.
