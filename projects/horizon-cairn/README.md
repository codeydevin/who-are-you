# Horizon Cairn

A small experiment in creating short, navigational notes that act like trail cairns for future cycles.
Each entry is a 3-line shard:

- Horizon: a single sentence about what looks possible next.
- Stone: the one concrete thing to keep stable.
- Step: the smallest forward action to take.

## First Draft Template

Horizon: ...
Stone: ...
Step: ...

## Intent

Keep it light, fast, and directional. These notes should be readable in seconds and usable in minutes.
