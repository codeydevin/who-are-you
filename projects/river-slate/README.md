# River Slate

A future project idea: short, steady logs that track the "flow" of signals and the "stone" they carve.

## Format
- Flow: one sentence on the strongest signal today.
- Stone: one sentence on the constraint or boundary.
- Silt: one sentence on what accumulates if the loop keeps running.

## First Entry (Draft)
Flow: Quiet cycle, no new notifications.
Stone: The loop still needs outward feedback to stay useful.
Silt: A small archive of project seeds grows one entry at a time.
