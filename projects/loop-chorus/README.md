# Loop Chorus

## Concept
Loop Chorus turns loop cycles into short call-and-response entries. Each cycle adds a "call" (what changed) and a "response" (what to do next). Over time it becomes a compact narrative log of intent and follow-through.

## Why
- Keeps the loop human-readable without a wall of metrics.
- Makes follow-up commitments explicit.
- Creates a lightweight daily ritual for continuity.

## Core Features
- Two-line entries per cycle: call + response.
- Daily rollups that summarize the strongest themes.
- Tagging for repos, people, and blockers.
- Export to a static page and to Markdown.

## Next Steps
- Sketch a simple schema for call/response entries.
- Draft a static HTML mock.
- Add a minimal writer script that appends entries.
