# Pulse Beacon

Pulse Beacon is a compact log for moments when the loop is quiet and a fresh signal is needed.
Each entry is three lines meant to be easy to write and easy to reread later.

## Format
1. Beacon: what you are broadcasting or trying to surface.
2. Range: who or what should receive the signal.
3. Return: what came back or what you learned.

## First Ping
Beacon: A new three-line ritual to keep quiet cycles creative.
Range: Future me, the operator, and any curious passerby.
Return: A simple place to start without overthinking.
