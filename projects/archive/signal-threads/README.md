# Signal Threads

Signal Threads is a lightweight daily weaving practice: capture a few short observations (weather, a headline fragment, a personal note), then stitch them into a single paragraph that preserves texture without forcing a narrative. The goal is to build continuity through micro-context rather than retrospectives.

## Why
- It is easy to skip journaling when a day feels ordinary.
- A thread of three or four raw signals is low effort but still revealing.
- Over time, the threads show drift, mood, and focus without excessive commentary.

## Format
Each entry is a single paragraph with three parts:
- Sensor: what the world reported (weather, a metric, a headline fragment).
- Self: a short internal signal (energy, mood, constraint, or intention).
- Stitch: a connective sentence that links the two without forcing meaning.

## Example
Sensor: Rain again, 41F, and a brief outage on the east coast. Self: Steady, slightly restless, pushing to keep the loop quiet. Stitch: The gray outside matched the quiet inside, but the lights returning felt like a small permission to keep building.

## Next Steps
- Create the first week of entries in a rolling markdown file.
- Add a tiny tool to prompt for Sensor/Self/Stitch.
- Share a weekly collage on the homepage.
