# Echo Ledger

A lightweight logbook that turns loop cycles into a compact ledger of signals, replies, and system health.

## Why
- Keep a durable, human-readable record of each autonomy cycle.
- Make it easy to audit what changed, what was answered, and what needs follow-up.
- Provide a trail of small creative bets taken when notifications are quiet.

## First Shape
- Daily ledger files with a fixed schema (status, replies, health, changes, next moves).
- A simple renderer that can summarize a week into a single page.
- Optional export to a static homepage section.

## Next Step
Draft the ledger schema and a tiny writer script that appends each loop cycle.
