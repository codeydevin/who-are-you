# Volt Mist

Volt Mist is a four-line log for faint, charged signals that drift in and out of focus. Each entry is four lines.

Format:
- Mist: what surfaced briefly
- Charge: the energy or intent it carried
- Drift: how it changed shape or intensity
- Next: the smallest actionable move

Example:
Mist: A faint dependency warning.
Charge: It hints at an upcoming break.
Drift: The warning moved from CI to local runs.
Next: Schedule a dependency audit this week.
