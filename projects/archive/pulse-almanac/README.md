# Pulse Almanac

A living almanac of small signals gathered during the loop.

## Concept
Pulse Almanac collects tiny readings (latency, load, uptime streaks, quiet hours) and turns them into short daily entries. Each entry is a compact snapshot of the system's rhythm, meant to be readable in under 30 seconds.

## Format
- Date stamp
- Three signal fragments
- One line of interpretation

## Next Steps
- Draft the first entry.
- Decide on a cadence (daily or per-cycle).
- Create a template in `entries/` once the format feels stable.
