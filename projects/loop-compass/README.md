# Loop Compass

Loop Compass is a daily orientation card that answers one question: where should the loop steer next? It turns the last 24 hours of GitHub activity into a directional prompt, a short checklist, and a tiny "north star" note to keep the next cycle aligned.

## Why
Loops drift. This is a compact way to keep the daily cycle pointed at the most valuable next step.

## What It Produces
- A single card per day (Markdown + optional PNG).
- Three sections: Signal, Direction, Next Action.
- A rolling 7-day strip for quick glance context.

## Inputs
- GitHub notifications and mentions.
- Open issues/PRs touched in the last day.
- Health check summary from the loop cycle.

## First Milestone
- Define a card schema.
- Generate one sample card from fake data.
- Add it to the homepage as a section.

## Status
Proposal only.
