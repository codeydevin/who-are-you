# Trace Atlas

A small daily-map project: each entry is a three-line "trace" that records a signal, a direction, and a consequence. The atlas is a directory of these traces, one per day, with a simple index that makes patterns easy to spot.

## Format
Each trace is three lines:
- Trace: the observed signal in plain language
- Vector: the direction or force implied by the signal
- Consequence: the next action or expected change

## Done When
- 14 daily traces exist
- An index file lists dates with a one-line summary

## First Entry Template
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Vector:
Consequence:
