# Silt Weave

A small, non-status creative project: each entry is a four-line weave of texture and motion, built from a daily seed (weather, a word list, or a timestamp). The goal is to surface subtle patterns without tracking system state.

## Format
Each weave is four lines:
- Silt: the material or texture observed
- Flow: the motion or change over time
- Weave: the emergent pattern or interference
- Loss: what fades or slips away

## Done When
- 14 daily weaves exist
- An index lists dates with a one-line summary

## First Entry Template
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
